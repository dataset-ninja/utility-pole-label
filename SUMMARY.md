**Utility Pole Label** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 186 images with 293 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*utility-pole*).

Each image in the Utility Pole Label dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (7 images) and *train* (179 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/new-workspace-en1on).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
